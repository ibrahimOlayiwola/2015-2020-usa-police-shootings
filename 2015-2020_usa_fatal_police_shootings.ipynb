    "### Introduction\n",
    "The year 2020 will be a year that lives long in the memory of man. The year was filled with major happenings all over the world. From the Australian bush fires, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle quiting the British royal family to the death toll numbers from COVID-19. The United States of America (USA) was the worst hit by the COVID-19 according to [numbers from John Hopkins University](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although [social distancing](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public) being one of the many reccommended ways to reduce and stop the spread of COVID-19, people all over the world protesting for one issue or another defied the advice. One of the issues was the fatal [killing of George Floyd, an African American, by Police officers](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-investigation.html) in the United States. The protest on the killing reverberated accross the world as months earlier an African American woman of name [Breonna Taylor was fatally shot by police in her apartment](https://www.nytimes.com/article/breonna-taylor-police.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Her killing which might have been preventable was what inspired this analysis."
